#Okay First things first you need to download the IDLE for python which will let you make your code

#https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.2/python-3.6.2.exe
#Just click here and it should download and install
#Once it's installed search for IDLE on your pc
#Once that starts click File the New and a second window should appear
#Once it appears this is the window you do your programming in, we're ready to start!

#For a simple hello world program we need to tell the computer 2 things
#1: what is has to do and 2: what data it does the action with
#so in our case the program has to say something
#and that "something" is hello world"

#in python the way we get the program to output something is to use the word print

print("Hello world")

#using this above, anything inbetween the speech marks is output

#we can even get it to store words and output them together

name = James
surname = Matchett

print(name+" "+surname)

#press F5 to run this program, but you have to save it before it runs!

#if you need any help just raise another issue!
