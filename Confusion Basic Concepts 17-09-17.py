
#You asked "Why does this: print('print("print")')
#Become this:              print("print")


print('print("print")')

#Okay this works above as it will output anything between the outer speech marks
#because I could even type

print("print('print')")
#which switches the speech marks to apostaphes (and vice versa) 

#and it will output the same thing, it just always takes it from the outer
#speechmarks or apostraphes



name1 = "James"
name2 = "matchett"

print(name1 + " " + name2)

#above is also a way to do concatenations
