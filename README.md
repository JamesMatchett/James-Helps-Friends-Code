# James-Helps-Friends-Code

this is just a little repo for me helping friends and strangers coding etc

If you need help with any programming just message me or merge your code in as an and I'll upload the (hopefully) fixed version.

Or even if you have general "how to get into coding" or tech support problems I'm ehre to help, just send in an issue.
